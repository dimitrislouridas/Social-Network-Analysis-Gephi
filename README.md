# Social Network Analysis with Gephi

This repository contains a **social network analysis project** developed using the **Gephi** platform.
The project focuses on analyzing network structure, identifying important nodes, and detecting communities
within a social graph.

The analysis was conducted as part of an academic assignment and is documented in the attached report.
